Topic: Linear Algebra - Matrices and Determinants

1. Matrices:
- Matrix Multiplication: Defined only if the number of columns in the first matrix equals the number of rows in the second matrix.
- Identity Matrix (I): A square matrix with 1s on the diagonal and 0s elsewhere. AI = IA = A.

2. Determinants (for 2x2 Matrix):
- If A = [[a, b], [c, d]], then det(A) = ad - bc.

3. Inverse of a Matrix:
- A square matrix A is invertible only if det(A) ≠ 0.
- For 2x2 matrix A: A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) * [[d, -b], [-c, a]].

4. System of Linear Equations (Cramer's Rule):
- For a system AX = B:
- If det(A) ≠ 0, there is a unique solution.
- If det(A) = 0 and (adj A)B ≠ 0, there is no solution (Inconsistent).
- If det(A) = 0 and (adj A)B = 0, there are infinitely many solutions (Dependent).
