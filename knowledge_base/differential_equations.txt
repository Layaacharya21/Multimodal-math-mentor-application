First Order Linear Equation:
dy/dx + Py = Q (where P, Q are functions of x)
1. Find Integrating Factor (IF) = e^(∫ P dx)
2. Solution: y * (IF) = ∫ (Q * IF) dx + C

Variable Separable:
Group all 'y' terms with 'dy' and 'x' terms with 'dx', then integrate both sides.

Pitfall: Ensure the coefficient of dy/dx is 1 before identifying the function P for the Integrating Factor.
