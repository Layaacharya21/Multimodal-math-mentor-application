Circle Equations:
Standard form: (x - h)² + (y - k)² = r², where (h,k) is center and r is radius.
General form: x² + y² + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0. 
- Center: (-g, -f)
- Radius: sqrt(g² + f² - c)

Tangent Condition:
The line y = mx + c is tangent to x² + y² = a² if c² = a²(1 + m²).

Common Error: Always ensure the coefficients of x² and y² are equal to 1 before calculating the center or radius from the general form.
