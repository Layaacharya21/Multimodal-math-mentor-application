Arithmetic Progression (AP):
- n-th term = a + (n-1)d
- Sum (Sn) = (n/2)[2a + (n-1)d]

Geometric Progression (GP):
- n-th term = a * r^(n-1)
- Sum (Sn) = a(r^n - 1) / (r - 1)
- Infinite Sum (for |r| < 1): S∞ = a / (1 - r)

JEE Tip: Many "series" problems are actually Arithmetico-Geometric Progressions (AGP). Use the method of shifting and subtracting to solve.
