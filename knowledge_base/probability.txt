Topic: Probability and Combinatorics

1. Basic Probability:
- P(A) = (Number of favorable outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)
- P(A') = 1 - P(A) (Complement rule)
- Addition Rule: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

2. Conditional Probability:
- P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B), provided P(B) ≠ 0.
- This represents the probability of event A occurring given that event B has already occurred.

3. Independent Events:
- Two events A and B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).

4. Bayes' Theorem:
- P(A | B) = [ P(B | A) * P(A) ] / P(B)
- Used to revise the probability of an event given new evidence.

5. Permutations and Combinatorics:
- nPr (Permutation - Order matters): n! / (n-r)!
- nCr (Combination - Order does not matter): n! / [r! * (n-r)!]
- Useful relation: nCr = nC(n-r)
